<!-- Explain what your extension does. -->

## Media Mail Shipping Category

The USPS Media Mail calculator determines eligibility based on a product’s shipping category.

To ensure Media Mail rates are available, make sure your store includes a shipping category named "Media Mail”, and that all eligible products are assigned to it.

You can create this category automatically by running your seed file:
```shell
bin/rails db:seed
```

## Installation

Add solidus_usps to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_usps'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_usps:install
```

## Usage

<!-- Explain how to use your extension once it's been installed. -->

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
You can load Solidus core factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusUsps::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```
